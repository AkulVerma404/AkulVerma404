# 💫 About Me:
🔭 I’m currently working on<br>Refining my High-RPM Motor Telemetry and Safety Test Bench, specifically focusing on FFT-based vibration analysis and real-time sensor fusion.<br>Developing ultra-lightweight tachometer solutions for high-performance UAVs to improve flight efficiency.<br><br>🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on<br>Open-source Robotics or Industrial Automation projects involving PLC integration (Siemens, Allen Bradley, etc.).<br>Embedded Systems projects that require hardware-software co-design using ESP32, Arduino, or Raspberry Pi.<br><br>🆘 I’m looking for help with<br>Advanced Verilog Programming and complex Semiconductor Fabrication simulations to further my recent certification knowledge.<br>Scaling IoT-enabled monitoring systems for industrial-grade motor protection and predictive maintenance.<br><br>🌱 I’m currently learning<br>Deep-diving into Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) and advanced Industrial Protocols like CAN and SPI for more robust embedded communication.<br>Enhancing my skills in Control Systems and Robotic Kinematics to build more agile mechanical frames.<br><br><br>💬 Ask me about<br><br>Mechatronics & Robotics: From designing pole-climbing robots to winning university robotics competitions.<br>PLC & Automation: My experience deploying four different PLC platforms to reduce equipment downtime.<br>Sensor Integration: How to use sensor fusion to evaluate structural health and motor performance.<br><br>⚡ Fun fact<br>I’ve spent enough time with stepper motors to know that they don’t just move; they sing. If you pulse the step frequency just right, you can actually make the motor windings play music—though I usually prefer they stick to the precise, "no-missed-steps" movement I programmed them for.<br>In embedded design, I live in a world where a "long time" is measured in milliseconds. When you’re optimizing C++ code for an ESP32 or ARM-based microcontroller, you start to realize that a single inefficient loop is an eternity for a microcontroller.
